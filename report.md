# Reflective Report

I found this assignment an engaging task, and I'm pleased that I found both areas where I noticed I was able to apply the course content comfortably, and new challenges that I had to solve. This makes me feel I balanced consolidating knowledge with leaving my comfort zone to pursue continued learining. While completing each task, I note feeling high enjoyment and high frustration at different points, but I look back on the whole with pride in what I have achieved in the time I had to dedicate to the project. 

I recall the first tasks felt comfortable, with familiarity coming from practicing the skills in workshops. This was a great way to begin the project, being someone who finds starting more daunting than continuing once started, and being able to make quick progress on the first two tasks helped me get over this quickly. The third task presented me with frustration. I had set a goal of creating a project that someone could replicate from my code, and decided that giving someone the dependency of downloading the same CSVs was a problem to be solved. I attempted to fetch the CSV from github and parse it in the cropped.py script, but quickly ran into issues manipulating a zip file. Although I found this initially frustrating I quickly reassessed my ambition, which was a good early learning oppotunity that helped me focus for the rest of the project. It taught me that my instinct to perfect each section in order was not a good approach, and from then on I tried to reach a working solution as simply and quickly as possible.
Once re-focused, I took issues in my stride, and enjoyed the process of iterating, debugging, and refactoring until I came up with python scripts for tasks 3 and 4. I was able to become deeply engrossed in these tasks, enjoying the feeling of deep focus - each problem I found was an engaging challenge rather than an annoyance. I put this down to the approach I explained above and how this let me build momentum. I believe this is an approach I will take away from this assignment, and I'm excited to tackle future projects this way.
The one part of the project that I'm somewhat disappointed with is the NoSQL modelling. Although I'm proud of the problem solving that I went into getting a working answer to the question, I again had ambitious goals for producing a cohesive, useful end product rather than only completing the assignment task to the minimum level required, and the time I spent on non-viable solutions and finding fixes meant I was unable to pursue these. I manage this disappointment by resolving to reuse this assignment in a personal project, and paying attention to the lesson of not setting high goals without a clear plan in place. Overall, I come away from this module proud of what I achieved and pleased with learning and practicing so much content. 

As for learning outcomes, I felt comfortable and enjoyed applying my understanding of relational modelling to designing a normalised entity-relationship model. I'm looking forward to applying this framework to professional and personal projects.
I believe I gained lots of understanding for using NoSQL data stores through researching them, and particularly from considering how each had pros and cons directly relating to my data and use case. This was a different viewpoint from the lectures. Additionally, I began to see that even within one data store technology, there were different approaches to designing schemas that are more or less appropriate depending on use case, such as normalized vs denormalized models. I notice greater nuance to my understanding of this topic from beginning to end of this practical assignment. 
I believe I was successful at showing understanding, evaluation, and application of a range of data query and manipulation languages though my successful modelling and querying in SQL and Quest. Additionally, I'm proud that i was able to manipulate the data effectively with python, and gained confidence in transforming data within the extraction and loading scripts. One small regret is that my choice of NoSQL technology didn't provide an oppotunity to practice XML for document manipulation and querying. This is a new skills I learned during this module that I think will be valuble, and its a shame I didn't get to challenge myself by chosing a language significantly different from SQL. But on reflection, I wouldn't change my approach of chosing what I believed to be the best framework for the problem at hand just to practice XML, because I'm proud of my final solution. 

Overall, I believe I achieved lots of learning goals during this project, overcame challenges, grew as a programmer, and gained considerable confidence in my data management knowledge and skill.
